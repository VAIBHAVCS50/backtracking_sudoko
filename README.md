# Sudoku Solver

A simple web application for solving Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. This application allows you to input a Sudoku puzzle, click the "Solve" button, and watch as it efficiently finds the solution. If the puzzle is not solvable, the app will inform you. You can also clear the grid and input a new puzzle.

## How It Works

The Sudoku Solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solution. The algorithm efficiently explores possible numbers for each cell while adhering to Sudoku rules.
If it reaches a point where it cannot make any more moves without violating these rules, it backtracks to the previous cell and explores other possibilities until a valid solution is found.

## Usage

1. Access the [Sudoku Solver Demo](https://backtracking-sudoku-solver.vercel.app/).
2. Enter your Sudoku puzzle by typing the numbers into the grid.
3. Click the "Solve" button to find the solution.
4. If the puzzle is not solvable, you'll be notified.
5. Click the "Clear" button to clear the grid and enter a new puzzle.
